# Project Title
Smart Diet Companionâ€“ Serverless Web Platform for Nutrition Tracking

## Project Overview

This project is a collaborative, serverless nutrition tracking platform designed to help users monitor and improve their dietary habits. It leverages cloud technologies and machine learning to provide personalized nutrition insights.

- The platform is built using AWS for cloud infrastructure, Python for backend services, and React for the user interface.
- It integrates smoothly with external nutrition APIs to provide accurate nutrition data.
- Containerized machine learning models are deployed using Docker, enabling scalable and reliable dietary recommendations.
- A personalized recommendation engine uses a greedy optimization algorithm to analyze users' nutrient intake and offer actionable dietary suggestions.
